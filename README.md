# TDD - anagram kata

This repository is a simple **Test Driven Development** kata. The main goal is to write function that checks is given parameters are anagrams. It uses **red, green, refactor** metodology:
- **RED:** write test that won't pass,
- **GREEN:** write minimal ammount of code that passes the tests,
- **REFACTOR:** simplify the code, improve it's quality.

I've used **Python** language and **Pytest** framework with unit test parametrization to complete that task.
New tests, code development and all baby-steps are shown clearly in repository commits.
